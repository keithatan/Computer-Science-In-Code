Quick thanks for being intrested in contributing to the CS directory :). This page consists of the style guide and steps to contributing!

# Steps to adding anything!
1. First check if the topic you would like to contribute has been made, if it has, check if the language you wanted to use has been done already.
2. If yes, you can try and refractor their code, and in the Pull Request explain why your version is better!
3. If no, keep the standard style here is an example.

1. We want to add Quick Sort.
2. We go to the sorting algorithms folder.
3. We add a Quick Sort folder using the standard naming method we have, this-is-an-example (aka kebab case with lower case only).
4. Then we add a folder for the language we are using, in this case c-sharp
5. now we add the project file/folder. 
* NOTE THIS FILE/FOLDER MUST RUN IN THE CONSOLE.
* In c-sharp we make a folder with the program file, in javascript we can just make a file and use node to run it
7. IF THERE IS NONE, Add a README.md file that follows the "Contributing Template" structure, please don't put your name on this page, keep it for the contributors list. IF THERE IS ONE, check if you can add anything or make it better!
8. Make sure project runs with example data. (you can and should leave example data in the file/folder)
9. Add your name to the contributors list! 
10. Add your language to the table of contents! Ex: (C#|<NEWLANGUAGE>|<ANOTHERONE>).
11. Submit a Pull Request with a little description and notes if needed, Within a week it should get merged as long as everything passes!
12. If the Pull Request does not pass, check the comments for the reason why and fix it accordingly then you can make another Pr, or resubmit the same one.
