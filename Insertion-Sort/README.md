# Insertion Sort

With Insertion Sort we compare the current element with the element ahead of it. Lets use a unsorted array of numbers as an example, if the number ahead is smaller then the current number then we can toss is behind and keep going with the current number. All the numbers behind the current number will also get sorted as we move down the array.

## Complexity

| Best            | Average             | Worst               |
| :-------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------: | 
| n               | n<sup>2</sup>       | n<sup>2</sup>       |
